1. Set your Stripe credentials in your `.env` file. Specifically `STRIPE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET`
1. Set your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file. This is needed for Voyager to correctly resolve asset URLs.

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`
1. `php artisan serve` or use Laravel Valet or Laravel Homestead
1. Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser

## Windows Users - money_format() issue

The `money_format` function does not work in Windows. Take a look at [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6369887/alternative-to-money-format-function-in-php-on-windows-platform/18990145). As an alternative, just use the `number_format` function instead.

1. In `app/helpers.php` replace `money_format` line with `return '$'.number_format($price / 100, 2);`
1. In `app/Product.php` replace `money_format` line with `return '$'.number_format($this->price / 100, 2);`
1. In `config/cart.php` set the `thousand_seperator` to an empty string or you might get a 'non well formed numeric value encountered' error. It conflicts with `number_format`.


1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
1. Follow the rest of the steps above. Instead of `php artisan ecommerce:install`, migrate and seed the normal way with `php artisan migrate --seed`
